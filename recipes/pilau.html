    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Pilau is a popular East African rice dish (especially in Kenya and Tanzania), made by cooking rice with beef, chicken, or vegetables, in broth and spices. It goes by many names such as pilaf (US) and pilau (UK). The earliest documented recipe goes back to the 20th Century scholar Abu Ali Sina.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Basmati rice</li>
        <li>Pilau masala</li>
        <li>Diced beef</li>
        <li>Cruched garlic and ginger</li>
        <li>Whole spices</li>
        <li>Cooking oil</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>f not using store-bought seasoning, prepare the ground pilau masala spice by roasting the whole spices (cumin seeds, green cardamom pods, cinnamon sticks, black peppercorn, and cloves). Use a food processor or coffee grinder to process it into powder.</li>
        <li>Next, clean the rice by rinsing it in a bowl until the water is no longer cloudy. Once clean, soak the rice using cold water.</li>
        <li>Soak the whole spices in a cup or a small ramekin.
        </li>
        <li>Boil the meat using water, salt, and the stock cube until tender. This could be goat, beef, lamb or poultry meat, it all depends on what you like. Sieve any excess broth and set it aside, for use when cooking the pilau rice.</li>
        <li>Fry the meat and onions until brown, then add the garlic, ginger, and tomato paste. Add the soaked whole spices plus any liquid leftover from soaking the spices, the pilau masala powder, and the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Next, add hot water (plus any reserved broth), followed by the rice.</li>
        <li>Finally, cook until the rice is tender and all the liquid has evaporated and then serve.</li>
    </ol>
