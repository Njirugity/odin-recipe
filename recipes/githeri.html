            <h1>The best Kenyan Githeri recipe</h1>

            <p>Githeri, also known as mutheri or muthere, is a traditional one-pot meal comprising boiled corn (or
                maize) and beans, that originated in Central Kenya. It was referred to as the traditional dish of the
                Kikuyu people in Central Kenya but has since seen its popularity spread to other parts of the country
                due to its tasty, nutritious, and affordable nature. It is also consumed in other parts of Africa and
                goes by several names (Adalu in Nigeria, and corn chaff in Cameroon). You can make it from scratch or
                use already-boiled canned or frozen corn and beans, for convenience.</p>
